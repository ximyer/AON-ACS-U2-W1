# Unit 2: Recursive Art 🎨

## Overview:
In this unit, students will learn/review recursion and use their knowledge to create visualizations.


### Shapeception:
Students will create art using recursively generated shapes.

### Tasks:
- Review visualization libraries for your language by creating simple drawings (P5 works well for JavaScript, and there is also Procesing for Python), but you can use whatever you like. 
- This video shows the spirit of the assignment and how various rendentions of recursive drawings might look, but the video itself is a demo of a tool that was made by an ITP student. Here is another inspirational source, but this time with a bit of pseudocode and actual code.. 
- Research various recursive (sometimes called “fractal”) shapes: Sierpinski’s Triangle, Koch Snowflake ,etc. 
- The Nature of Code, 8.1-8.5 has a good explanation of recursion and implementation details written in Processing (which is built on top of Java).
- Create a new replit in the language of your choice.
- Develop an idea for your drawing and explain it using a new “.draw” drawing in replit or a new “.txt” or “.md” planning document.
- In your planning document develop a recursive algorithm for drawing subsequent recursions based on user interaction in pseudocode. Make sure to include a base case
- Implement
